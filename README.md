#Purpose And Goals
+ The purpose of this website is to provide a cool experience for users to check out some of the top moments of Michael Jordan's and Kobe Bryant's careers in the form of GIF animations.  I provide an interactive homepage with a number of animations that link to separate pages for both the highlights of Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan. I hope viewers, whether or not they are a fan of Kobe or MJ, appreciate these awesome moments in their careers! They are some of the greatest to ever play the game!

##Explanation of starred items

###Breakpoints
+ I include breakpoints at both 700px and 1000px on all three pages of the project which result in desktop, tablet, and mobile views. On the homepage, there are three columns that appear in a row at the desktop view. At the tablet view, two images stack on top of one. At the mobile view, each of the images stack on top of each other. On both the Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant pages, there are 2 images in a row that stack on top of 3 images in a row that stack on top of 4 images in a row. At the tablet view, both pages have 2 images in a row that stack on top of 3 images in a row, which then stack on top of the same 4 images, except those images are split into 2 rows of 2 images. At the mobile view, all of the images stack on top of each other, one by one. 

###CSS Animation On A Continuous Loop
+ There is a CSS animation on a continuous loop at the center of my homepage. It is a linear 12 second sliding animation of a blue wave behind the photo of MJ and Kobe. 

###CSS Animation On User Interaction
+ Both the Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant have a skew aniamtion that reacts to a hover. The image of Jordan skews right and the image of Kobe skews left. 

###Background Image
+ I have included a background image on each of the three linked pages. An outline of a basketball is the background of the homepage, the MJ Jumpman logo is the background of the Michael Jordan page, and the Kobe Mamba logo is the background of the Kobe Bryant page. 

###jQuery Animation 
+ There is a jQuery animation on the center of my homepage. I have a "Toggle Bold" button that toggles the bold of the text at the center of the page which reads, "It's not that one is necessarily the better player. They're just different! See for yourself!"
